# AIDEV

Include specially formatted comments throughout the codebase for inline knowledge. Use the following prefixes for comments:
- `AIDEV-NOTE:` for general notes or explanations.
- `AIDEV-TODO:` for tasks that need to be completed.
- `AIDEV-QUESTION:` for questions or uncertainties.

Before adding new comments, always grep the files for existing `AIDEV-` comments to maintain consistency. Update relevant anchors after completing any task. Add anchor comments for:
- Complex code.
- Critical or important sections.
- Potentially buggy code.

Ensure all comments and anchors are clear, concise, and relevant to the context.
